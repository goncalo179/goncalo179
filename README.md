## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm GonÃ§alo

I'm a data science enthusiast with a background in translation and languages â€” now fully immersed in turning complex data into actionable insights. After pivoting from a master's in translation to data science, I've completed multiple end-to-end projects involving recommendation systems, customer behavior analysis, and lead prioritization using machine learning.

### ðŸ“Œ Featured Projects
- **[Amazon Electronics Recommendation System](https://github.com/goncalo179/RecommendationSystem)**  
  Trained and evaluated several algorithms, recommended hypertuned SVD for deployment using RMSE, precision, and recall as benchmarks.

- **[Uber Eats Order Behavior Analysis](https://github.com/goncalo179/UberEatsAnalysis)**  
  Explored customer preferences and delivery patterns, suggested strategies like themed promotions and prioritizing high-demand cuisines.

- **[Lead Prioritization for Conversions](https://github.com/goncalo179/LeadPrioritization)**  
  Built decision trees and random forest models to identify high-conversion leads, optimizing outreach strategies.
